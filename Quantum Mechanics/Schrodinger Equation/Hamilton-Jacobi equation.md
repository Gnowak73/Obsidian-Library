The Hamiltonian-Jacobi equation is used in classical mechanics as an equivalent formulation to Hamiltonian Mechanics, Lagrangian Mechanics, or Newtonian Mechanics. It is used in the [[Derivation of Schrodinger Equation]] and also can be used in General Relativity via the [[Hamilton-Jacobi-Einstein Equation]].
