The Schrodinger Equation was originally derived using the [[Hamilton-Jacobi equation]] and looking for a result with three main assumptions:
1. Such equation must classically approach the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (Since we know from De Broglie of wave particle duality and the solution $S(\vec{r},t)$ of the HJE described particles but is also closely related to a waves since the surfaces $S(\vec{r},t) = const$ are wave-fronts, a result used in optics)
2. Such equation must be a 2nd order Differential Equation (to produce the experimentally observed waves)
3. Such equation should be linear (to produce phenomenon of [[Superposition Linear ODE and PDE|Superposition]]) 

With these assumptions, the Schrodinger Equation can be constructed using the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation! 

Dimensional Analysis can also be used to see how the action is assumed to be a phase of a wave, which brings about the $\frac{1}{\hbar}$ term to cancel out the units of the action $(L^{2}T^{-1}M)$. 

Such derivations can also be seen in Weinstock's _Calculus of Variations_, on [pages 261 - 262](http://books.google.com.vn/books?id=6wSVuWH1PrsC&pg=PA263&dq=%22the%20so-called%20schrodinger%20equation%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vDDVUaLhKIjWPZudgPAC&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22the%20so-called%20schrodinger%20equation%22&f=false)
