**Theorem.**  If a function $f$ is analytic at all points interior to and on a simple closed contour $C$, then 
$$
\int\limits_{C} f(z) \ dz = 0
$$

This is an extension of Cauchy's theorem, which said the same thing but with the added condition that the partial derivatives were continuous (so $f'$ would be too), this condition is from Green's Theorem stating that you need continuous partial derivatives. 

Goursat proved that we didn't need that extra condition for the complex plane. This theorem is derived by using [[Green's Theorem on the Complex Plane]]. The proof where we get rid of the extra $f'$ continuity condition can be seen in [[Complex Variables Textbook.pdf]].
