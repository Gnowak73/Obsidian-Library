**Euler's Theorem** is a statement that is the general version of [[Fermat's Little Theorem]]. This theorem is based upon a function called the [[Euler Totient Function]]. 

**Theorem.**  Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ and $a\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\gcd(a,n)=1$, then 
$$
a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n
$$
where $\phi(n)$ is the [[Euler Totient Function]].
