The exponential shift operator is a useful operator of the form 
$$
e^{aD_{x}}f(x+a)
$$
where $x$ could be substituted for any other variable. This allows us to trickily manipulate shifted functions and use Operator Calculus to get around integrals, convolutions, etc. Originally attributed to Oliver Heaviside.
