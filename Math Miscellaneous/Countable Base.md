A base (basis) of a topology is such a collection of open sets that any other open set can be written as a union of elements of the base. A base is countable if it has countably many elements in it. 

A set is **countable** if either it is _finite_ or it can be made in one-to-one correspondence with the set of **Natural Numbers**. Equivalently, a set is _countable_ if there exists an _injective function_ (one-to-one) from it into the natural numbers; this means that each element in the set may be associated to a unique natural number, or that the elements of the set can be counted one at a time, although the counting may never finish due to an infinite number of elements.

```ad-Definition
A topological space $X$ has a countable basis at point $x$ if there is a countable collection $B$ of neighborhoods of $x$ such that each neighborhood of $x$ contains at least one of the elements of $B$. A space that has a countable basis at each of the points satisfies the First Countability Axiom, or is first-countable.
