Fermat's Little Theorem is a statement regarding exponents and the modulus of prime numbers. This theorem can be states in the two different ways below. It is also worth noting that Fermat's Little Theorem is just the specific case from [[Eulers Theorem]] where we are taking the modulus with respect to a prime number. 

**Theorem A.**  Let $p$ be a prime and $a$ be an integer, then 
$$
a^{p}\equiv a\mod{p}
$$
**Theorem B.**  Let $p$ be a prime and let $a$ be an integer in the set $\{1,2,\ldots p-1\}$. Then
$$
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p
$$
