A common technique used to solve or simplify integrals. It is as follows:
$$
\int\limits u \ dv = uv - \int\limits v \ du 
$$
This can also be written as:
$$
\int\limits f(x) \frac{dg(x)}{dx}dx = f(x)g(x) - \int\limits g(x) \frac{d(f(x))}{dx}dx
$$

Finally, the best method to use integration by parts is the DI method ([DI method BPRP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I-_SV8cwsw)):
