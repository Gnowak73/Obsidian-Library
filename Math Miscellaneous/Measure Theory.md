###### Sigma Algebras
When we begin to talk about measure theory, we must understand what the motivation for a measure is. Say we take a subset of the real line. Now, naturally, we may ask "how do we measure this subset", in other words, "what is the measure?" This is what measure theory is all about, we want to give the subsets a meaningful measure, or generalized volume. And in this scenario of the real line, a generalized length. 

The notion of length is what you know from the real line from looking at intervals. If we have the interval $[a,b]$, then we would say that it has a length of $b-a$. The question is now, what do we do when the subset is complicated? So, we want to generalize this notion of length, such that in different problems we can use different definitions of length to make our problems easier (such as adding weight to different parts of a subset). 

Now, when generalize what we know from the real line to abstract sets $X$. For this set we want to measure the generalized volumes of the subsets, which we will call the "measure." At the level of the set, we need something called the power set of $X$. 

```ad-Definition
The **power set** of a set $X$, $P(X)$, is the set of all subsets of $X$.
```

**Remark.** Do not forget that the empty set $\emptyset$. 

Now we give the definition of measurable sets. When we say "measurable set", you may recognize the idea that we don't have to measure all of the subsets we can form, but maybe only some. If we have a large amount of subsets and we only have a select few that we want to measure, then this may be sufficient enough for our theory. 

Now, let us look at a subset of the power set, $A \subseteq P(X)$. Such a collection is called a $\sigma$-algebra by the definition below:

```ad-Definition
A set $A \subseteq P(X)$ is a $\sigma$-algebra if:
1. $\emptyset, X \in A$
2. $a \in A \rightarrow a^{c} \equiv X\setminus a \in A$
3. $a_i \in A, i \in \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \bigcup^{\infty}_{i=1} a_{i}\in A$
```

Note that we have countable many subsets (either finite or $\sim \mathbb{N}$). In other words, for the second condition, if we have $A$, which is measurable, and we know that a subset $a$ is measurable, then $a^c$ must be measurable for $A$ to be measurable. For the third condition, visualize having a set $A$ with a subset $a$. Now, we take subsets of $A$, denoted $a_i$. If each subset has a generalized volume, then the infinite countable sum of each subset should make up the generalized volume of $A$. The first condition is simply that we want the most trivial sets to be measurable, and our goal is to be able to measure $X$ and its subsets.

```ad-Definition
The elements in the $\sigma$-algebra will be called the "measureable sets." Or, $a \in A$ is called an $A$-measurable set.
```

Now, note that the two most trivial $\sigma$-algebras are $A=\{\emptyset,X\}$ and $A=P(X)$. Now, for the complicated examples that we want to work with in measure theory, we obviously will have a set between these two trivial ones.

##### Boreal Sigma Algebras
Imagine you have a lot of different $\sigma$-algebra on a set, which we will call $A_{i}, i \in I$. We can easily see that $\bigcap_{i \in I}A_{i}$ is also a $\sigma$-algebra on $X$. 

```ad-Definition
For $M \subseteq P(X)$, there is a smallest (with respect to the set inclusion) $\sigma$-algebra that contains $M$:
$$
\bigcap_{A \supseteq M} A \equiv \sigma(M)
$$
where $A$ are sigma algebras.
```

**Remark.**  This may also be referred to as "the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $M$. 

**Example.**  Let us have $X = \{a,b,c,d\}$ and $M = \{\{a\},\{b\}\}$, then 
$$
\sigma(M) = \{\emptyset, X, \{a\},\{b\},\{a,b\},\{b,c,d\},\{a,c,d\},\{c,d\} \}
$$
which is derived using all three properties described prior but with the condition that $M$ must be in the sigma algebra. But what if we have an infinite set?

```ad-Definition
Let $(X,\tau)$ be a topological space (or let $X$ be a metric space, or let $X$ be a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. (The goal here is that we have "open sets") 

The Boreal $\sigma$-algebra on $X$, $B(X)$, is the sigma algebra generated by the open sets.

$$
B(X) = \sigma( \tau)
$$
where $\tau$ is the topology (the set of open sets). 
```

 **Remark.**  The Boreal Sigma algebra introduces the ideas of open sets into measurable sets. In other words, we can work with infinite sets.


##### What is a Measure

```ad-Definition
$(X,A)$, for a set $X$ with a sigma algebra $A$, is called a measurable space.
```

```ad-Definition

A map $\mu:A \rightarrow [0,\infty]$ (note that we are including a new symbol "infinity" in the interval) is called a **measure** if it satisfies:

1. $\mu(\emptyset) = 0$
2. $\mu(\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}) = \sum_{i=1}^n \mu(a_i)$ where $a_{i}\cap a_{j} = \emptyset$(disjoint) and $a_{i} \in A$. (Property to add up volumes)
3. We want to be able to approximate volumes for infinite sequences $(A_{1},A_{2},\ldots)$ which are disjoint subsets. So we really want (2) to hold where $n=\infty$. We shall refer to this as (2) since this new condition covers the finite scenario in (2). We will call this property "sigma additive":
$$
\mu\left(\bigcup^{\infty}_{i=1}a_{i}\right) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(a_{i})
$$
```


**Remark.** We use the positive real numbers because we want to give a generalized volume or length, which of course needs to be a positive real number.

The first condition tells you that something must have volume greater than $0$, and the second condition tells you that you can calculate a volume by splitting it up into countable many disjoint subsets.

```ad-Definition
$(X,A,\mu)$ is called the **measure space**.
```

We define the calculation rules in $[0,\infty]$:
1. $x+ \infty \equiv \infty, x\in[0,\infty]$
2. $x \cdot \infty \equiv \infty, x\in(0,\infty]$
3. $0\cdot \infty\equiv 0$ (for most cases in measure theory)

**Examples of Measures:**  We will start with a set $X$ with $A = P(X)$. 

---
1. The counting measure: $\mu(a) \equiv \begin{cases} \# a, \quad \text{a has finitely many elements} \\ \infty, \quad \text{else} \end{cases}$
where $\#a$ is the number of elements in $a$.

---
2. The Dirac measure for $p\in X$: $\delta_{p}(a) \equiv \begin{cases} 1, \quad p\in a \\ 0,\quad \text{else} \end{cases}$
which can localize a measure to a specific point.

---
3. These two previous measures work on all sets. Now we search for a measure on $X=\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the properties:
	1. $\mu([0,1]^{n}) = 1$
	2. $\mu(x+a)=\mu(a)$ for all $x\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$
The first condition is that we want to be able to have a unit cube with volume $1$. The second condition is that we want a translationally invariant measure, as a volume that is translated in space should have the same volume.

We can in fact find a measure with these properties, which later on we call the **Lebesgue Measure**. 

---

#### Why The Lebesgue Measure Doesn't Work on the Entire Power Set

Let us look back at the measure problem stated prior. We are searching for a measure $\mu$ on $P(\mathbb{R})$ with:
1. $\mu([a,b])=b-a,\quad b>a$
2. $\mu(x+a)=\mu(a), \quad a\in P(\mathbb{R}),x \in \mathbb{R}$
we find that **the measure problem is not solvable**, hence why we must create a theory around using sigma algebras.

We will create a proof for this problem below.

**Claim:**  Let $\mu$ be a measure on $P(\mathbb{R})$ with $\mu((0,1])<\infty$ (this is clearly fulfilled when property 1 is fulfilled) and follows property (2). Then there is only one measure that satisfies this: $\mu=0$. Since $\mu$ doesn't fulfil (1), then there must be no measure with these two properties.

**Proof:**  First we will start with some definitions. Let $I \equiv (0,1]$ with the equivalence relation on $I$, $x\sim y$ if $x-y \in \mathbb{Q}$. Now, we can write that 
$$
[x] \equiv \{x+r |\ r\in \mathbb{Q}, x+r \in I\}
$$
Now, we may visualize that we have sets with elements $[x_{n}]$ for arbitrary $n$, where $x_{n}$ is just some arbitrary number on $I$. There will be an infinite amount of these sets, possibly an uncountable number of them. However, the important part is that we have a disjoint decomposition of $I$ (we always have this with **any** equivalence relation). 

Now, we define a set $A \subseteq I$, in which each element $a_{n} \in A$ describes a set $[x_{n}]$ such that $A = \{a_{n}\}$. But if we have an uncountable many number of sets $[x_{n}]$ we must slightly modify this picture, as it only works for countably many sets. 

We want $A \subseteq I$ with the property:
1. For each $[x]$, there is an $a \in A$ with $a \in [x]$ 
2. For all $a,b \in A$: $a,b \in [x] \rightarrow a=b$ 

The first property allows us to pick elements out of each $[x_{n}]$, then the second property tells us that this is unique (so we have disjointed sets). 

It is not clear how to do this representation. We need the axiom of choice from set theory (guarantees existence of a set with these two properties). We define 
$$
A_{n}\equiv r_{n}+A, \quad \text{where } (r_{n})_{n\in \mathbb{N}} \text{ enumeration of } \mathbb{Q} \cap (-1,1]
$$

In other words, $A$ is shifted by the rational numbers between $(-1,1]$. Now we have another claim we will make for this proof.

**Claim 2.**  $A_{n}\cap A_{m} = \emptyset$ if $n\neq m$. 

**Proof:** $x\in A_{n} \cap A_{m} \rightarrow x=r_{n}+a_{n}$ and $x=r_{m}+a_{m}$, where $a_{n},a_{m}\in A$. This implies that $r_{n}+a_{n}=r_{m}+a_{m} \rightarrow a_{n}-a_{m}=r_{m}-r_{n} \in \mathbb{Q}.$ Now due to our equivalence class defined before, then $a_{n}\sim a_{m}$ or $a_{n},a_{m}\in [a_{m}]$. Thus, $a_{n}=a_{m}$. This implies that $r_{n}=r_{m}$, but the $r$'s where chosen as an enumeration of the rational numbers, so the indices must coincide such that $n=m$. Thus, if $x\in A_{n}\cap A_{m}$, then $n=m$. So by contraposition, Claim 2 is proven. 

Now, we look at the union 
$$
(0,1] \subseteq \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} A_{n} \subseteq (-1,2]
$$
where the subset equalities are seen by noting the maximum and minimum of $A_{n}$ and then adding it to $I$ since $A \subseteq I$. We will refer to this property as (c).

Now, we go to the core of the proof. 

Assume that $\mu$ is a measure on $P(\mathbb{R})$ with $\mu((0,1])<\infty$ and (2). By (2), we see that $\mu(r_{n}+A)=\mu(A)$ for all $n\in \mathbb{N}.$ By (c), then 
$$
\tag{*}
\mu((0,1])\leq \mu\left(\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}A_{n}\right) \leq \mu((-1,2])$$
We know that $\mu((0,1])\equiv C <\infty$ for some number $C$. We use the $\sigma$-additivity to then show that 
$$
\mu((-1,2]) = \mu((-1,0] \cup (0,1] \cup (1,2])
$$
due to measure invariance across translations we see that 
$$
\mu((-1,2]) = 3C
$$
From (\*), and property (2) of the definition of a measure, we can note that 
$$
C \leq \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\mu(A_{n}) \leq 3C
$$
which implies that (due to translation invariance)
$$
C \leq \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}\mu(A) \leq 3C
$$
Note that we have a fixed number in an infinite series. Thus, the series will diverge if $\mu(A)>0$. Thus we can conclude then that $\mu(A)=0$ for the series to converge since $C$ is a real number that is less than $\infty$. Since $\mu(A)=0$, then $C=0.$ And since $C$ is just shorthand notation for the measure of the unit interval $I$. Then $\mu((0,1])=0$. 

We can create the real line by shifting the unit interval over and over again and taking the union, but to translational invariance:

$$\mu(\mathbb{R}) = \mu \left(\bigcup_{m\in Z^{+}}(m,m+1] \right) = 0
$$
which finally implies that 
$$
\mu = 0 \quad \square.
$$

**Remark.** We will give the formal definition for an equivalence relation and class below for memory's sake.

```ad-Definition
An equivalence relation on a set $X$ is a binary relation $\sim$ on $X$ satisfying the three properties:
1. $a \sim a$ for all $a \in X$
2. $a \sim b$ implies $b \sim a$ for all $a,b \in X$
3. if $a\sim b$ and $b \sim c$, then $a\sim c$ for all $a,b,c \in X$.

The equivalence class of an element $a$ is defined as:
$$
[a] = \{x \in X: a\sim x\}
$$
```

#### Measurable Maps

```ad-Definition
Let us have a map $f:\Omega_{1}\rightarrow \Omega_{2}$, where both sets are composed of a sigma algebra, denoted $(\Omega_{1},A_{1}),(\Omega_{2},A_{2}).$ 

$f$ is measurable (w.r.t $A_{1},A_{2}$) if $f^{-1}(a_{2}) \in A_{1}$ for all $a_{2}\in A_{2}$.
```

**Remark.**  This is a map between measurable spaces. And this condition says that a map is called measurable if the preimages of measurable sets are measurable.

Now you may ask, why do we need this? We can easily explain this when we consider an integral (which is the entire point of measure theory in the first place).

Say we have a graph that is zero everywhere except for a particular portion that is flat with a height of one over an interval. So we have a function everywhere zero except for a small interval in which it is at height 1, creating a rectangle area underneath the curve. 

If we want to measure this interval, and the function is $f$, then the set we want to measure is $f^{-1}(\{1\})$. And for the $x$ axis, we just need an abstract measure space $(\Omega,A,\mu)$. Now, we can measure the volume of the set with $\mu(f^{-1}(\{1\})).$ Hence, for a meaningful integral, we want to measure sets of this form. But since the measure $\mu$ is only defined on a sigma algebra, what we really need is $f^{-1}(\{1\}) \in A$. 

So with the preimage definition, we can guarantee that if we have a measurable set on the y axis, we can get a measurable set on the x axis. And because we put the preimage of functions in the measure, we need this condition. This will solve a problem that will come later.

**Example:**  Let us look at $(\Omega,A), (\mathbb{R},B(\mathbb{R})$. Now, one can look at the common characteristic function (also called the indicator function), which we defined by
$$
\chi_{a}:\Omega\rightarrow \mathbb{R}, \quad \chi_{a}(\omega) \equiv \begin{cases}1, \quad \omega\in a \\ 0, \quad \omega\notin a\end{cases}
$$
For this, we can conclude that from all measurable sets $a \in A$, the characteristic function $\chi_{a}$ is a measurable map. Since we only have two values for the function, we will look at this case by case.

Now, we can see that $\chi^{-1}_{a}(\emptyset)=\emptyset$ and $\chi^{-1}_{a}(\mathbb{R})=\Omega.$ Of course, this is for all maps of this form. Now, we can see that $\chi^{-1}_{a}(\{1\})=A$, and $\chi^{-1}(\{0\})=A^{c}$. Now, these are all of the preimages we can get out. 

Note of course that $\emptyset, \Omega \in A$ and by assumption, $A \in A$, and by definition, $A^{c}\in A$. Thus, all preimages are measurable, and so $\chi_{a}$ is a measurable map!

**Example 2:**  Now, we chose three measurable spaces $(\Omega-1 ,A_{1}),(\Omega_{2},A_{2}),(\Omega_{3},A_{3})$. Then we can consider a composition
$$
\Omega_{1}\xrightarrow{f}\Omega_{2}\xrightarrow{g}\Omega_{3}
$$
The claim is now, if we put in two measurable maps $f,g$, then $g \circ f$ is measurable. Now, we look at the preimages, $(g \circ f)^{-1}(a_{3})=f^{-1}(g^{-1}(a_{3}))$ which holds for all maps. Now, if we know that $g$ is measurable, then $g^{-1}(a_{3}) \in A_{2}$, but now if $f$ is measurable, then $f^{-1}(g^{-1}(a_{3}))\in A_{1}$.

---
Lets now make some important remarks for measurable functions (maps into the real number line). This means that we now have two measurable spaces $(\Omega,A),(\mathbb{R},B(\mathbb{R})).$ Now let us look at two maps $f,g:\Omega\rightarrow \mathbb{R}.$ 

Of course, these two functions must be measurable with respect to the two sigma algebras. We can now look at combinations of these two functions. $f+g$ and $f-g$ are still measurable. If we look at multiplication, $fg$ is still measurable. We also have $|f|$ is measurable. 

---
### Lebesgue Integrals
Now, we consider the abstract measure space $(X,A,\mu)$, where $X$ is the set, $A$ is sigma algebra (subsets of $X$), and $\mu$ is the measure mapping $\mu:A\rightarrow [0,\infty].$ 

Now, we consider measurable maps $f:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}.$ Dont forget that we have a sigma algebra on the left, $A$, and a sigma algebra on the right $B(\mathbb{R})$. Also, we recall that measurable means that $f^{-1}(E)\in A$ for all Borel sets $E\subseteq \mathbb{R}.$ 

Now we look at our example from before, for $\chi_{a}:x\rightarrow \mathbb{R}, a\in A$. Since the portion of the graph with area just has height $1$, then no matter how abstract the measure, space, we know that the area must be equal to the measure of $a$. Thus the integral must be 
$$
I(\chi_{a}) \equiv \mu(a)
$$
There are other functions which we can also so this for, which we call "simple functions" or "step functions". A simple function $f$ is just a linear combination of such characteristic functions:
$$
f(x) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}c_{i} \chi_{a_{i}}
$$
And from our properties of measurable functions, we know then that $f$ must be measurable. 

We then can note that the Integral of these simple functions is just the sum of $c_{i}\mu(a_{i})$, or 
$$
I(f) \equiv \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}c_{i} \mu(a_{i})
$$
But there is one problem with this definition: if we have a set with the volume infinity. Say we have one set with measure $+\infty$ and one with $-\infty$. Then how do we add these two if $\infty$ is not defined? We may try to make the condition that $\mu$ must be a finite value for all sets. We may also try to say that the constants $c_{i}$ must be positive, then we don't have a problem adding up positive infinities, as they are just infinity.

We chose the second option, and define our "simple functions" as 
$$
S^{+}\equiv \{f:X\rightarrow\mathbb{R} | \ f\geq0\}
$$
Note that $S^{+}$ is almost a vector space, with the exception that we cannot scale however we want, so it is actually half of a vector space. We see looking back at our definition that $f$ is not uniquely defined in terms of the coefficients. This is okay, as the graph does not change, only how we represent the sum. Therefore another description for our representation of $f$ is: $f$ is measurable and takes only finitely many values. Both representations are equivalent.

In our case here, for $f\in S^{+}$, we chose the representation
$$
f(x) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}\chi_{a_{i}}(x), \quad c_{i}\geq0
$$
We now can define the Lebesgue Integral of $f$ with respect to $\mu$:
$$
\int\limits_{X}f(x) d \mu(x)=\int\limits_{X}f d \mu = I(f) \equiv \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}\mu(a_{i}) \in [0,\infty]
$$
This definition is a well-defined object, and does not depend on the chosen representation. 

We now want to expand this definition for more complex functions. But before we do that, lets look at some properties this integral has.

1. $I(\alpha f + \beta g)= \alpha I(f) + \beta I(g), \quad \alpha, \beta \geq 0$
2. $f\leq g \rightarrow I(f)\leq I(g)$   (monotonicity) 

We may now use monotonicity to expand our definition to general measurable maps. In order to get a visualization, consider some non-simple function with a measurable map with area below the graph and between the x axis. 

Let this function be smooth such that there are infinitely many values that $f$ takes on. The goal of the Lebesgue integral is to then approximate the function by finitely many values. 

We take two parts of the range of the function and then look for simple functions below the graph. In other words, we use the range to partition our graph into the measure of sigma algebras on the $x$ axis. (Note that we always take the lower part of the interval along the y axis for the step functions so that the step function is always below the graph)

![[Pasted image 20240817160857.png|center|300]]

for sigma algebra $A_{i}$(in the picture), or $a_{i}$ to be consistent with our formulations. We then see that for all other values on the y axis give the other $c_{i}$'s and all the corresponding $a_{i}$'s such that we can decompose the function into characteristic functions with height 
$$
h = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}c_{i} \chi_{a_{i}}
$$
Since $h$ always is below the graph, we can use the monotonicity to estimate the integral of the function. We now have the tools to create our integral definition.

```ad-Definition 
Let $f:X\rightarrow [0,\infty)$ be a measurable function. For each decomposition of the y axis, we can chose a step function with height $h$ that lies below $f$. If we chose $h \in S^{+}$, then we can look at $I(h)$ to create a set 
$$
\{I(h)| \ \ h\in S^{+},\ h\leq f\}
$$
The Lebesgue integral of $f$ with respect to $\mu$ is then
$$
\int\limits_{X}f d \mu \equiv \sup \{I(h)| \ \ h\in S^{+},\ h\leq f\}.
$$

$f$ is called $\mu$-integrable if $\int\limits_{X}f d \mu < \infty.$
```

The only thing we needed for this was a measure space $X$. However, we needed our function to map into real numbers. This guarantees there is order. On the x axis there is no order or anything but the measure so we cannot do the same decomposition on the x axis.
