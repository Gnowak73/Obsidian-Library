A nonsingular matrix is one which the only solution to 
$$
Ax=\pmb{0}$$
is the trivial solution $x=0$. The following properties for nonsingular matrices are equivalent:
1. $A$ is invertible (see [[Matrix Linear Algebra#Inverse Matrix|inverse matrix]])
2. $A$ is row equivalent to the Identity Matrix $I$
3. $Ax=0$ is only solved with the trivial solution $x=0$
4. For every n-vector $b$, the system $Ax=b$ has a unique solution
5. For every n-vector $b$. the system $Ax=b$ is consistent (has a solution)
6. The [[Determinant]] of $A$ is nonzero.
