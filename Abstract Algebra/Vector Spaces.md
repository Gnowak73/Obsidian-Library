Abstract algebra has three basic components: groups, rings, and fields. Thus far we have covered groups and rings in some detail and we have touched on the notion of a field. To explore fields more deeply, we need the rudiments of vector space theory that are covered in a linear algebra course. We shall provide a concise review of this material. 

```ad-Definition
A set $V$ is said to be a _vector space_ over a field $F$ if $V$ is an Abelian group under addition (denoted by $+$) and, if for each $a \in F$ and $v \in V$, there is an element $av$ in $V$ such that the following conditions hold for all $a,b$ in $F$ and all $u, v$ in $V$. 
1. $a(v+u)=av+au$
2. $(a+b)v=av+bv$
3. $a(bv)=(ab)v$
4. $1v=v$
```

The members of a vector space are called _vectors_. The members of the field are called _scalars_. The operation that combines a scalar $a$ and a vector $v$ to form the vector $av$ is called the _scalar multiplication_.  In general, we will denote vectors by letters from the end of the alphabet, such as $u,v,w$, and scalars by letters from the beginning of the alphabet, such as $a,b,c$.
