[[Normal Subgroups and Factor Groups]] play a special role in group theory$-$they permit us to construct factor groups. In this article, we introduce analogous concepts for rings$-$ideals and factor rings. 

```ad-Definition
A subring $A$ of a ring $R$ is called a (two-sided) _ideal_ of $R$ if for every $r \in R$ and every $a \in A$ both $ra$ and $ar$ are in $A$. 
```

So, a subring $A$ of a ring $R$ is an ideal of $R$ if $A$ "absorbs" elements from $R$; that is, if $rA \subseteq A$ and $Ar \subseteq A$ for all $r \in R$. 

```ad-Remember
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity and let $a \in R$. The set $\left<a \right> = \{ra \vert \ r \in R\}$ is an ideal of $R$ called the _principle ideal generated by $a$_. 
```


An ideal $A$ of $R$ is called a _proper_ ideal of $A$ if $A$ is a proper subset of $R$. In practice, one identifies ideals with the following test, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of ideal, and the subring test given before in [[Introduction to Rings#Subrings]]. 

**Theorem 16.1**  A nonempty subset $A$ of a ring $R$ is an ideal of $R$ if 
1. $a-b \in A$ whenever $a,b \in A$.
2. $ra$ and $ar$ are in $A$ whenever $a \in A$ and $r \in R$. 

##### Factor Rings 
Let $R$ be a ring and $A$ an ideal of $R$. Since $R$ is a group under addition and $A$ is a [[Normal Subgroups and Factor Groups|normal subgroup]] of $R$, we may form the factor group $R/A=\{r+A \vert \ r \in R\}$. The natural question at this point is how may we form a ring of this group of [[[Cosets and Lagrange's Theorem|cosets]]? The addition is already taken care of and, by analogy with groups of cosets, we define the product of two cosets $a+A$ and $b+A$ as $ab+A$. The next theorem shows that this definition works as long as $A$ is an ideal and not just a subring of $R.$

**Theorem 16.2**  Let $R$ be a ring and $A$ a subring of $R$. The set of cosets $\{r+A \vert \ r \in R \}$ is a ring under the operations $(s+A)+(t+A) = a+t+A$ and $(s+A)(t+A) = st+A$ if and only if $A$ is an _ideal_ of $R$.  

**Proof:**  The proof can be seen on page 211 of [[Joseph A. Gallian - Contemporary abstract algebra-Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH) (1989) (1).pdf|abstract algebra textbook]]. 

### Prime Ideals and Maximal Ideas
```ad-Definition
A proper ideal $A$ of a commutative ring $R$ is said to be a _prime_ ideal of $R$ if $a,b \in R$ and $ab \in A$ implies that $a \in A$ or $b \in A$. A proper ideal $A$ of $R$ is said to be a _maximal ideal_ of $R$ if, whenever $B$ is an ideal of $R$ and $A \subseteq B \subseteq R$, then $B=A$ or $B=R$. 
```

So, the only ideal that properly contains a maximal ideal is the entire ring. The motivation for the definition of a prime ideal comes from the integers. We have two fundamental theorem about these ideals and their nature. 

**Theorem 16.3**  Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity and let $A$ be an ideal of $R$. Then $R/A$ is an integral domain if and only if $A$ is prime. 

**Proof:**  Suppose that $R/A$ is an [[Integral Domains|integral domain]] and $ab \in A$. Then $(a+A)(b+A)=ab+A = A$, the zero element of the ring $R/A$. So, either $a+A=A$ or $b+A=A$; that is, either $a \in A$ or $b \in A$. Hence, $A$ is prime. Now, suppose that $A$ is prime and $(a+A)(b+A)=0+A=A$. Then $ab \in A$ and therefore, $a \in A$ or $b \in A$. Thus, one of $a+A$ or $b+A$ is zero. 

**Theorem 16.4**  Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity and $A$ an ideal of $R$. Then $R/A$ is a field if and only if $A$ is maximal. 

**Proof:**  For brevity, the proof can be found on page 215 in [[Joseph A. Gallian - Contemporary abstract algebra-Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH) (1989) (1).pdf|abstract algebra textbook]]
