In the Stern Gerlach experiment, we illustrate a radical departure from classical mechanics. First, silver atoms are heated in an oven. The oven has a small hole through which some of the silver atoms escape, and the corresponding beam goes through a collimator and is then subjected to an inhomogeneous magnetic field produced by a pair of pole pieces, one of which has a very sharp edge. 

Now, we will work with a simplified version of the mechanics to understand how the magnetic field affects the silver atoms. The silver atom is made up of a nucleus and 47 electrons, where 46 out of the 47 can be visualized as forming a spherically symmetrical electron cloud with no net angular momentum. If we ignore the nuclear spin, which is irrelevant in our discussion, we see that the atom as a whole does have an angular momentum, which is solely due to the spin$-$intrinsic as opposed to orbital$-$angular momentum of the single 47th (5s) electron. The 47 electrons are attached to the nucleus, which is $\sim 2\times 10^{5}$ times heavier than the electron; as a result, the heavy atom as a whole possesses a magnetic moment equal to the spin magnetic moment of the 47th electron. In other words
$$
\mu \propto S,
$$
where the proportionality factor turns out to be $e/m_{e}c$ to an accuracy of about $0.2\%$. Because the interaction energy of the magnetic moment with the magnetic field is just $-\mu\cdot B$, the z-component of the force experienced by the atom is given by 
$$
F_{z}=\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(\mu\cdot B) \approx \mu_{z} \frac{\partial B_{z}}{\partial z}, 
$$
where we have ignored the components of $B$ in the directions other than the $z$-direction. Now,
