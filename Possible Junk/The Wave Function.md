The wave function is a function representing the [[Probability]] density of finding a particle between a value of, say $x$, and $x+dx$ at a time, $t$. 

The wave function arises from the [[Schrodinger Equation]]: 
$$
\hat H\Psi = i\hbar\partial_t \Psi 
$$
where $\Psi$ is the wave function. In the late 1920's, Max Born derived that this function was actually a probability density. There are two other equations that can be solved for the wave function: The Dirac Equation, and The Klein Gordon Equation.

## Conditions
Some natural conditions arise from the [[Schrodinger Equation]] and logical reasoning for the Wave Function:

1. $\Psi$ must be continuous
2. $\partial_x \Psi$ must be continuous (applied for all spatial dimensions used in for the system)  
3. $\Psi$ must be normalizable
