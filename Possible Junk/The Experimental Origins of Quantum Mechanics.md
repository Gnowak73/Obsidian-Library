###### Is Light a Wave or a Particle?
Beginning in the late 17th century and continuing into the early 18th century, there was a debate in the scientific community over the nature of light. Isaac Newton claimed that it consisted of particles or "corpuscles." Christiaan Huygens claimed that it was a wave. 

Newton argued that the only corpuscular theory could account for the observed tendency of light to travel in straight lines. Huygens and others argued that a wave theory could explain lots of other aspects, including "refraction." 

In 1804, Thomas Young published two papers describing and explaining his double-slit experiment. In this experiment, sunlight passes through a small hole in a piece of cardboard and strikes another piece of cardboard containing two holes. The light then strikes a third piece of cardboard, where the pattern of light may be observed. Young observed "fringes" or alternating regions of high and low intensity light, which is the nature of  _interference_ in waves.

Despite the convincing nature of this experiment, many proponents of the corpuscular theory of light remained unconvinced. In 1818, the French Academy of Sciences set up a competition for papers explaining the observed properties of light. One of these submissions was by Fresnel, who created a new wave theory of light using Huygen's foundation. Poisson was not a supporter of this work, and argued that if Fresnel's theory was true, then light passing by an opaque disk would diffract around the edges of the disk to produce a bright spot in the center of the shadow of the disk. Nevertheless, the head of the judging committee, Arago, put the prediction to the test, which was experimentally proven. 

This led to the widespread acceptance of the wave theory of light, which expanded further in 1865 when James Clerk Maxwell showed that his equations predicted that electromagnetic waves would propagate at a certain speed, which agreed with observations. Thus, everyone believed that light was simply an electromagnetic wave and done deal. 

However, the first challenge came from blackbody radiation. A blackbody is an idealized object that perfectly absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that hits it. They can be approximated in the real world by an object with a highly absorbent surface. The problem of blackbody radiation concerns the distribution of electromagnetic radiation in a cavity within a blackbody. Although the walls of the blackbody absorb the radiation that hits it, thermal vibrations of the atoms that make up the walls cause the blackbody to emit electromagnetic radiation (At normal temperatures, most of the radiation emitted would be in the infared range). 

In the cavity, then, electromagnetic radiation is constantly absorbed and re-emitted until thermal equilibrium is reached, at which point the absorption and emission of radiation are perfectly balances at each frequency. According to the "equipartition theorem" of classical statistical mechanics, the energy in any given mode of EM radiation should be exponentially distributed, with an average value equal to $k_{B}T$.

The difficulty with this prediction is that the average amount of energy is _the same for every mode_. But since there are infinitely many modes, the energy in the cavity would be seen as infinite. This strange prediction is known as the **Ultraviolet Catastrophe**, since the infinite energy comes from the ultraviolet end of the spectrum. This does not seem to make physical sense and does not match with observed energy sprectrum. 

An alternative prediction was offered by Max Planck in 1900 who postulated that the EM field at any given frequency $\omega$ should be "quantized", meaning that this energy should come only in integer multiples of a certain basic unit equal to $\hbar \omega$, where $\hbar$ is a constant, which we now call Planck's constant. Planch postulated that the energy would again be exponentially distributed, but only over integer multiples of $\hbar \omega$. 

Planck's new theory match the experimental predictions, where the constant $\hbar$ is 
$$
\hbar = 1.054 \times 10^{-27}
$$
and these predictions made by the theory match the observed blackbody spectrum data.

Planck pictured the walls of the blackbody as being made up of independent oscillators of different frequencies with energies of $\hbar \omega$. Now, Planch thought that the energy quantization arose from the properties of the walls of the cavity, but Einstein argued that energy quantization was inherent in the radiation itself. In Einstein's picture, then, electromagnetic energy at a given frequency comes in packets, or "quanta", having energy proportion to the frequency. Each quantum of EM energy then constitutes what we call a "photon".

It is worth mentioning in passing, that in 1900, the same year which Planck's paper appeared, was when Lord Kelvin gave a lecture that drew attention to another difficulty with the classical theory of statistical mechanics. Kelvin described two "clouds" over 19th century physics at the dawn of the 10th century. The first of these clouds concerned auther, a hypothetical medium which EM radiation propagates, and the failure of the Michelson and Morley to observe the motion of Earth relative to the aether. Under this cloud lurked the theory of special relativity. The second cloud concerned the heat capacities in gases. The equipartition theorem made predictions for the ratio of heat capacity at constant pressure and the heat capacity at constant volume. These predictions deviated substantially from the experimentally measured ratios. Under this second cloud lurked the theory of quantum mechanics, because the resolution of this discrepancy is similar to Planck's resolution of the blackbody problem. As in the case of blackbody radiation, quantum mechanics gives rise to a correction to the equipartition theorem that can reconcile predictions of $c_{p}$ to $c_{v}$ to observed results. 

The year 1905 was when Einstein's annus mirabilis happened, where he published 4 groundbreaking papers: 2 on special relativity, 1 on Brownian motion, and 1 on the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect is an effect that: while EM radiation strikes a metal causing electrons to be emitted from the metal, and we increase the intensity of the incident light, the number of emitted electrons increases, but their energies do not change. In a sense, it seems that they are too "quantized". Classically, we expect that increasing the intensity of the light amounts to increasing the strength of the electric and magnetic fields involved, which ought to increase the amount of energy transferred to the electrons. 

Einstein, argues that light is a stream of "photons" with discrete energies such that increasing intensity of the light increases the number of photons and does not affect the energy of each photon. And the energy of the escaping electron will be determined by the frequency of the incident light and not by the intensity of the light. 

Although the work of Planck and Einstein suggests that there is a particlelike aspect to light, there is certainly also a wavelike aspect to light. Thus, somehow, light must in some situations behave like a wave and in some situations behave like a particle. 

JJ Thomson suggested in 1907 that the patterns of light seen in the double slit experiment could be the result of different photons somehow interfering with one another. Thomson thus suggested that if the intensity of light were sufficiently reduced, the photons in the light would become widely separated and the interference pattern might disappear. In 1909, Geoffrey Ingram Taylor set out to test this suggestion and found that the interference pattern still remained the same. 

This result suggests that interference remains even when the photons are widely separated. Thus, the photons are not interfering with one another, rather, as Paul Dirac puts it, "each photon then interferes only with itself." To put it in another way, each individual photon passes through **both** slits. 

###### Is an Electron a Wave or a Particle
In the early part of the 10th century, the atomic theory of matter became firmly established. Experiments performed in 1909 by Geiger and Mardsen, under the direction of Rutherford, led Rutherford to put forward in 1911 a picture of atoms in which a small nucleus contains most of the mass of the atom. In Rutherford's model, each atom has a positively charged nucleus with charge $nq$, where $n$ is a positive integer (the atomic number) and $q$ is the basic unit of charge first observed in Millikan's famous oil-drop experiment. Surrounding the nucleus is a cloud of $n$ electrons, each having a negative charge $-q$. When atoms bind into molecules, some of the electrons of any one atom may be shared with another to form bonds. This picture led to the modern theory of chemistry. 

However, it did not take a long time until the wavelike properties of electrons began to be observed. The situation was then reverse of what happened with light. Electrons were initially thought to be particles, but they seem to have wavelike properties too.

###### The Spectrum of Hydrogen
If electricity is passed through a tube containing hydrogen gas, the gas will emit light. If that light is separated into different frequencies by means of a prism, bands will become apparent, indicating that the light is not a continuous mix of many different frequencies, but only of a discrete family of frequencies. The energy in each photon is proportional to its frequency. Thus, each observed frequency corresponds to a certain amount of energy being transferred from a hydrogen atom to the electromagnetic field. 

Now, a hydrogen atom consists of a single proton surrounded by a single electron. Since the proton is much more massive, one can picture the proton as being stationary, with the electron orbiting it. The idea then, is that the current being passed through the pas causes some of the electrons to move to a higher-energy state. Eventually, that electron will be moved to a lower energy state and emit a photon in the process. In this way, one can work backwards to change find the change in energy of the electrons. 

Since the energy of the emitted photons are discrete, so much be the energies of the electron. Based on the observed results, Rydberg concluded in 1888 that the possible energies of the electron were of the form:
$$
E_{n} = - \frac{R}{n^{2}}
$$
Here, $R$ is the Rydberg constant, given by 
$$
R = \frac{m_{e}Q^{4}}{2 \hbar^{2}}
$$
where $Q$ is the charge of the electron and $m_{e}$ is the mass of the electron. (Technically, $m_{e}$ should be replaced by the reduced mass $\mu$ of the proton-electron system. However, since the proton mass is much greater, $\mu$ is almost the same as $m_{e}$ and we will neglect the difference between the two.) These energies agree with experiment, in that all the observed frequencies in hydrogen are of the form
$$
\omega = \frac{1}{\hbar}(E_{n}-E_{m}) 
$$
for some $n>m$. The frequencies noted above are known to be the **spectrum** of Hydrogen. However, there were not yet any theoretical explanation for why only these particular frequencies occur. Such as explanation would have to wait for the beginning of quantum theory in the 20th century. 

##### The Bohr-de Broglie Model of Hydrogen
In 1913, Niels Bohr introduced a model of the hydrogen atom that attempted to explain the observed spectrum of Hydrogen. Bohr pictured the hydrogen atom as consisting of an electron orbiting a positively charged nucleus, in much the same way that a planet orbits the sun. Classically the force exerted on the electron by the proton follows the _inverse square law_ of the form 
$$
F = \frac{Q^{2}}{r^{2}}
$$
where $Q$ is the charge of the electron in appropriate units. (Coulomb's Law) 

If the electron is in a circular orbit, its trajectory in the plane of the orbit will take the form
$$
(x(t),y(t)) = (r \cos (\omega t), r \sin (\omega t))
$$
If we take the second derivative with respect to time we obtain the acceleration 
$$
\mathbf{a}(t) = (-\omega^{2}r \cos (\omega t), - \omega^{2}r \sin(\omega t))
$$
so that the magnitude of the acceleration vector is $\omega^{2} r$. Newton's second law, $F=ma$, then requires that 
$$
m_{e} \omega^{2}r = \frac{e^{2}}{r^{2}}
$$
so that 
$$
\omega= \sqrt{\frac{Q^{2}}{m_{e}r^{3}}}
$$
From the formula for the frequency, we can calculate that the momentum has magnitude
$$
p = \sqrt{\frac{m_{e}Q^{2}}{r}}
$$
We can also calculate the angular momentum $J$, which for a circular orbit is just the momentum times the distance from the nucleus, as 
$$
J = \sqrt{m_{e}Q^{2}r}
$$
Bohr postulated that the electron obeys classical mechanics, _except_ that its angular momentum is "quantized." Specifically, in Bohr's model, the angular momentum is required to be an integer multiple of $\hbar$. Setting $J$ equal to $n \hbar$ yields
$$
r_{n} = \frac{n^{2}\hbar^{2}}{m_{e}Q^{2}}
$$
If one calculated the energy of an orbit with radius $r_{n}$, one finds that it agrees precisely with the Rydberg energies. Bohr further postulated that an electron could move from one allowed state to another, emitting a packet of light in the process with frequency given prior. 

Bohr did not explain _why_ the angular momentum was quantized, nor how it moved from one allowed orbit to another. As such, his theory was not complete; it belongs to the "old quantum mechanics" that was superseded by Heisenberg and Schrodinger's matrix and wave models. 

In 1924, Louis de Broglie reinterpreted Bohr's condition on the angular momentum as a wave condition. The de Broglie Hypothesis is that an electron can be described by a wave, where the spatial frequency $k$ of the wave is related to the momentum of the electron by the relation 
$$
p = \hbar k
$$
Here "frequency" is defined so that the frequency of the function $\cos (kx)$ is $k$. This is "angular" frequency, which differs by a factor of $2 \pi$ from the cycles-per-unit-distance frequency. Thus, the period associated with a given frequency is $2 \frac{\pi}{k}$. In this new approach, we are supposed to imagine a wave superimposed on the classical trajectory of the electron, with the quantization condition now being that the wave should match up with itself when going all the way around the orbit. This means that the orbit should consist of an integer number of periods of the wave: 

![[Pasted image 20240613153839.png|center|400]]

$$
2 \pi r = n \frac{2 \pi}{k}
$$
Using our prior momentum condition for the de Broglie hypothesis along with the expression prior for $p$ in the Bohr model, we obtain
$$
2 \pi r = n 2 \pi \frac{\hbar}{p} = 2 \pi n \hbar \sqrt{\frac{r}{m_{e}Q^{2}}}
$$
Solving this equation gives precisely the Bohr radius. Thus, de Broglie's wave hypothesis gives an alternative to Bohr's quantization of angular momentum as an explanation of the allowed energies of hydrogen. Of course, if one accepts this new hypothesis, then we should expect this wavelike behavior in other situations too.

###### Electron Diffraction
In 1925, Davisson and Germer were studying properties of nickel by bombarding a thin film of nickel with low-energy electrons. As a result of a problem with their equipment, the nickel was accidentally heated to a very high temperature. When the nickel cooled, it formed into large crystalline pieces, rather than the small crystal in the original sample. After this process, it was observed that there were new peaks in the pattern of electrons reflecting off the nickel sample. They were at a loss to explain this pattern, until Davisson learned of he de Broglie hypothesis and suspected that they were observing the wavelike behavior of electrons. They continued their work and were able to show correspondences between patterns of electrons and diffraction patterns from x-rays. 

###### Double Slit Experiment with Electrons
Although quantum theory still predicts that electrons passing through a double slit will experience interference similar to that observed in light, it was not until Clauss Jonsson's work in 1961 that this prediction was confirmed experimentally. The main difficulty is dealing with the small wavelengths, and Akira Tonomura in 1898 was able to record results of _one electron at a time_. 


Each individual electron passing through the slits acted like particles, and were not smeared our in an interference pattern. But, as many electrons were sent through the apparatus, we see that the locations of these electrons have a wave interference pattern.
