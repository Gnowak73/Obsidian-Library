The most familiar concept in thermodynamics in **temperature**. It's also one of the trickiest concepts. Thus, we will not delve into full detail in this article. For now, however, let's start with a naive definition.

```ad-Definition
**Temperature** is what you measure with a thermometer.
```

This is what's called an operational definition, because it tells you how to _measure_ the quantity in question. Ok, but why does this procedure work? Well, the mercury in the thermometer expands or contracts, as its temperature goes up or down. Eventually the temperature of the mercury equals the temperature of the soup, and the volume occupied by the mercury tells us what that temperature is. 

Note that our thermometer (and anything else) relies on the following fundamental act: when you put two objects in contact, and wait long enough, they tend to come to the same temperature. This property is so fundamental that we could make an alternative definition of temperature to be:

```ad-Definition
**Temperature** is the thing that's the same for two objects, after they've been in contact long enough. 
```

This is more of a **theoretical definition** of temperature. However, it is extremely vague. What kind of "contact"? How long is "long enough"? And so on.

Before tackling these questions, lets introduce some more concepts:

```ad-Definition
After two objects have been in contact long enough, we say that they are in **Thermal equilibrium**.

The time required for a system to come to thermal equilibrium is called the **relaxation time**. 
```

Now, what do we mean by "contact"? A good enough definition for now is that it requires two objects to be able to exchange energy spontaneously in the form we call "heat." Intimate mechanical contact usually works fine, but even if the objects are separated by empty space, they can "radiate" energy to each other in the form of electromagnetic waves. If you want to _prevent_ two objects from coming to thermal equilibrium, you need to put some kind of thermal insulation in between. And even then, they'll eventually come to equilibrium; all we are really doing is increasing the relaxation time.

There are also other types of equilibriums. The most common are represented below

Notice that for thermal equilibrium we are claiming that the exchanged quantity is _energy_. We'll see some evidence for this in the following article. 

When two objects are able to exchange energy, and energy tends to move spontaneously from one to the other, we say that the object that gives up energy is at a _higher_ temperature, and the object that sucks in energy is at a _lower_ temperature. With this convention in mind, let me now restate the theoretical definition of temperature:

```ad-Definition
**Temperature:** is a measure of the tendency of an object to spontaneously give up energy to its surroundings. When two objects are in thermal contact, the one that tends to spontaneously _lose_ energy is at the _higher_ temperature. 
```

We shall return to this theoretical definition later.

Thermometers operate on the principle of thermal expansion. To define actual _units_ for temperature, we pick two convenient temperatures, such as the freezing and boiling points of water, and assign them arbitrary numbers, such as $0$ and $100$. We then mark these two points on our thermometer, measure off a hundred equally spaces intervals in between, and declare that this thermometer now measures temperature on the Celsius scale, by definition!

Interesting stuff happens if our thermometer uses gas. If we extrapolate the scale of a thermometer down to very low temperatures, we are led to predict that for any low-density gas at constant pressure, the volume should go to _zero_ at approximately $-273.15 \degree \ C$.
