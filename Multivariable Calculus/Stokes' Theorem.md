A Theorem relating the integral of the curl over a surface to the line integral. Unlike [[Green's Theorem (circulation)]], which is a special case of Stokes' Theorem, this can be used for 3D surfaces and not just for planes. It states that:
$$
\int_{C}\vec{f}\cdot d\vec{r} = \int\int_{S}\nabla\times \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{S}
$$
